This fallacy is based on the premise that committing to the current plan is justified because resources have already been committed. This mistake may result in improper long-term strategic planning decisions based on short-term committed costs. In addition this cloud our ability to form new ideas from fresh perspective."},"Mind/Famine,-Affluence-And-Morality":{"title":"Famine, Affluence And Morality","links":[],"tags":["mind"],"content":"There are things we have to do and other optional. In other words\nobligatory things vs supererogatory\nObligatory vs supererogatory §\nImagine you’re have a meeting. You’re in the meeting room earlier than everyone. You felt thirsty, so you drink up from a bottle you have, but you think to yourself what if everyone else is thirsty. You have idea, it’ll be nice you would placed bottle at the each person place, you got time, meeting won’t start in 15min. You went back and got all the bottle from company kitchen and placed on there.\nYou don’t have to do it, but it’s a nice thing to do. but if you were an assigned person to this sort of things done than it’s in your obligation to do it.\nNow that I hope you have clear idea of the two words let’s move on.\nIs it obligatory to help in relief efforts? §\nMost of use would think donating money and help in famine or refugee instead of spending money on less moral significant thing such as buying new cars and new phone when the old one work perfectly fine. We don’t have to donate to help but it’s nice if we do, Right?. Well, singer says, no it is a duty to donate and help in those relief, it’s immoral to be otherwise.\nFamine, Affluence and Morality §\nIn Famine, Affluence and morality paper by Peter Singer in 1971 the statement was -\n\nIf it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of moral significance, then we ought, morally, to do it.\n\n“Something bad” meaning hunger, death, disaster, murder, bad suffering and so on. “Morally insignificant things” are such as buying a luxury cars which we don’t really need to survive or morally make no difference. Or the abundance of jewelry we buy, phones, video games, nice headphones.\nSave a drowning child §\nImagine, you’re on your way to work, a very important event at work today, but you see a child drowning in lake on the way, Well?, despite risking being late and getting your suit messed up, most of us would no doubt help the child.\nA child drowning is a very bad thing and risk getting messed up our suit and being a little is not of moral significant. Beautifully supporting the philosophy.\nObligatory to donate §\nThis mean it is obligatory to donate in famine relief organization to help people in whatever terrible place it is right now by sacrificing not buying new shiny shoes when our current shoes work perfectly, not buying next iPhones and cars. It’s immoral otherwise.\nObjection by proximity §\nWait donating to famine relief isn’t the same thing a drowning child in front of my eyes.\nWell, if you’re living medieval age that would be justifiable argument, but today age and days technologies connect the whole world and not being able to help due to distance is no longer an excuse.\nThis does not invalidate singer point as well.\nObjection by Peers §\nYou’d think other people are donating the charities it wouldn’t be the end of the world for me to not donate and buy new clothes?.\nWell, how do you think if I say “There were other people nearby, so I didn’t save the drowning child” or “Or I was waiting for other people nearby to recuse the child so just passed by”. Singer says the responsibility falls to the individual and it’s not an moral excuse to whether if other people available to help.\nThis does not invalidate singer point as well.\nConclusion §\nSinger’s argument is general in scope and not limited to the famine relief or any particular disaster at hands. It’s as controversial as it sound it’s as radical.\nThen we’re all evils? §\nAre we all evil to spending most of our income on ourselves and luxury?\n\n“If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of moral significance, then we ought, morally, to do it.” - Peter Singer\n"},"Mind/Mind":{"title":"Mind","links":["Mind/Avoiding-Sunk-Cost-Fallacy","Mind/Unveiling-Lasting-Happiness","Mind/Famine,-Affluence-And-Morality","Mind/Success-And-Money---The-Behavioural-Side-of-Things"],"tags":["mind"],"content":"\nAvoiding Sunk Cost Fallacy\nUnveiling Lasting Happiness\nFamine, Affluence And Morality\nSuccess And Money - The Behavioural Side of Things\n"},"Mind/Success-And-Money---The-Behavioural-Side-of-Things":{"title":"Success And Money - The Behavioural Side of Things","links":[],"tags":["mind"],"content":"These are key-points discussed from the book “Psychology of money” by Morgan Housel.\nThe impact of luck and risk §\nSome religion describe luck as a positive destiny that was brought upon by past life’s do goods. And bad luck is a form of punishment for wrong doings in the past life.\nBut a more general definition of luck I think we could all agree is that outcomes and consequences you cannot control or foresee whatsoever are just happen to be in your favor. Bad luck is the otherwise.\nWhile personal actions and decisions matter, luck and risk play significant roles in our financial outcomes. Recognizing the influence of luck cultivates humility and guards against overconfidence. Additionally, understanding and managing risk is crucial for long-term financial stability. Diversification and avoiding large, irreversible mistakes can help mitigate the impact of unexpected events.\nCompounding §\nBuilding wealth is not about overnight success or chasing quick gains; it’s about harnessing the power of compounding. By consistently saving and investing over time, even small amounts can grow exponentially. The key is to have patience and think long-term, allowing your money to work for you and accumulate wealth gradually. Most of Warren Buffet money are made after he’s over 60. Disney almost went out of business before snow white. Success comes from executing consecutive horrible ideas. Ideas must acted upon.\nMoney is not just math §\nFinancial success is heavily influenced by our behaviors and mindset. Our emotions, biases, and tendencies impact our financial decisions more than we realize. Understanding our own behavioral patterns, such as our inclination to avoid losses or follow the crowd, can help us make better choices and avoid common financial pitfalls.\nFinancial Security §\nSaving money and living below our means are essential for financial security. Regardless of income level, adopting a frugal mindset and being intentional about spending can create a solid financial foundation. Saving not only provides a safety net but also opens up opportunities for investment and wealth creation.\nResilience afd Adaptability §\nFinancial well-being requires resilience and adaptability. Being able to thrive in the face of adversity is crucial. Embracing uncertainty, learning from failures, and being flexible in our financial plans can help us navigate economic downturns and unexpected challenges. Building multiple income streams and having a diversified portfolio contribute to long-term resilience.\nThe Value of Contentment §\nTrue wealth extends beyond monetary figures. It lies in finding contentment and satisfaction in non-financial aspects of life. Understanding our own values and aligning our financial goals accordingly can lead to a healthier and more balanced approach to money. Focusing on what truly brings us joy and fulfillment rather than constantly chasing more money can lead to a more satisfying life overall.\nBy embracing these key points, we can develop a more holistic and mindful approach to our finances, leading to greater financial well-being and long-term success."},"Mind/Unveiling-Lasting-Happiness":{"title":"Unveiling Lasting Happiness","links":[],"tags":["mind"],"content":"Discovering genuine and lasting happiness is a universal pursuit that goes beyond external achievements. Drawing inspiration from the principles of positive psychology, this article explores valuable insights on happiness.\n1. Authentic Happiness §\nTrue happiness lies in aligning our values, passions, and actions. By gaining self-awareness and living in harmony with our core values, we can unlock a sense of fulfillment and lasting joy.\n2. The Power of Positivity §\nPositive emotions play a vital role in our overall well-being. Embracing moments of joy, practicing gratitude, and actively seeking positive experiences can significantly impact our happiness.\n3. Embracing Failure and Building Resilience §\nFailure should be viewed as an opportunity for growth rather than a reason for fear. Learning from setbacks and cultivating resilience enables personal development and resilience in the face of challenges.\n4. Nurturing Meaningful Relationships §\nMeaningful connections and social support networks contribute significantly to our happiness. Cultivating relationships through active listening, empathy, and kindness fosters personal growth and a sense of belonging.\n5.
